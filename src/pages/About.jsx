            <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> BeatDHacker was born from seeing too many casual device users fall victim to hacking due to a lack of technical knowledge. Inspired by the <strong>JS Mastery 1 Million Hackathon (huge congrats to Adrian!),</strong> I decided to create this platform to bridge the knowledge gap. Your feedback and thoughts are essential to shaping the future of BeatDHackerâ€” <strong>let's build something great together</strong>.</p>
